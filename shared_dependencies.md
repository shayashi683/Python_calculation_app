# Shared Dependencies and File Responsibilities

1. **main.py**: This is the entry point of the application. It is responsible for initializing the application, handling user input, and coordinating between the UI, calculation engine, and history feature. It imports functions from `ui.py`, `calculation_engine.py`, and `history.py`.

2. **calculation_engine.py**: This file contains the core calculation functions. It exports functions for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and advanced mathematical operations (exponentiation, square root, logarithm). It also exports a function to validate user input.

3. **history.py**: This file manages the history of calculations. It exports functions to add a calculation to the history, retrieve the history, and clear the history. It uses an in-memory dictionary to store the history.

4. **ui.py**: This file handles the user interface. It exports functions to display the menu, get user input, and display the result or error messages. It imports functions from `calculation_engine.py` and `history.py` to perform calculations and manage the history.

# Shared Data Schemas

The history of calculations is stored in a dictionary with the following schema:

```
{
    'calculation_id': {
        'operation': 'add',
        'inputs': [1, 2],
        'result': 3
    },
    ...
}
```

# Shared Message Names

Error messages and prompts are defined in `ui.py` and used in `main.py` and `calculation_engine.py`.

# Shared Function Names

The following function names are used across multiple files:

- `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `exponentiation`, `square_root`, `logarithm`: These are the calculation functions defined in `calculation_engine.py` and used in `main.py`.

- `validate_input`: This function is defined in `calculation_engine.py` and used in `main.py` to validate user input.

- `add_to_history`, `get_history`, `clear_history`: These functions are defined in `history.py` and used in `main.py` to manage the history of calculations.

- `display_menu`, `get_user_input`, `display_result`, `display_error`: These functions are defined in `ui.py` and used in `main.py` to handle the user interface.

# Backend Routes

As this is a CLI application, there are no backend routes. The application is run locally and does not communicate with a server.
